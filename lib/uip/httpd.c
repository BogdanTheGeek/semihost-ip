/**

 * @{
 *
 * The uIP web server is a very simplistic implementation of an HTTP
 * server. It can serve web pages and files from a read-only ROM
 * filesystem, and provides a very small scripting language.
 *
 * The script language is very simple and works as follows. Each
 * script line starts with a command character, either "i", "t", "c",
 * "#" or ".".  The "i" command tells the script interpreter to
 * "include" a file from the virtual file system and output it to the
 * web browser. The "t" command should be followed by a line of text
 * that is to be output to the browser. The "c" command is used to
 * call one of the C functions from the httpd-cgi.c file. A line that
 * starts with a "#" is ignored (i.e., the "#" denotes a comment), and
 * the "." denotes the last script line.
 *
 * The script that produces the file statistics page looks somewhat
 * like this:
 *
 \code
i /header.html
t <h1>File statistics</h1><br><table width="100%">
t <tr><td><a href="/index.html">/index.html</a></td><td>
c a /index.html
t </td></tr> <tr><td><a href="/cgi/files">/cgi/files</a></td><td>
c a /cgi/files
t </td></tr> <tr><td><a href="/cgi/tcp">/cgi/tcp</a></td><td>
c a /cgi/tcp
t </td></tr> <tr><td><a href="/404.html">/404.html</a></td><td>
c a /404.html
t </td></tr></table>
i /footer.plain
.
 \endcode
